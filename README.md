# Python Automation Portfolio

A collection of Python automation scripts and mini-projects built while learning Python, data structures, and applied data science. This portfolio demonstrates my progression from fundamental scripting to more advanced data-driven applications.

## Featured Projects (Applied Data Science)

- **music-recommender-engine** — A data-driven project that builds a simple recommendation system using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis of a music dataset. It highlights skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying logical operations.

## Mini-Projects

- **simple-calculator** — A CLI calculator with input validation, division-by-zero handling, and history logging.

- **the-collatz-sequence** — A CLI tool that computes and displays the Collatz sequence for a given integer.

- **to-do-list** — A CLI To-Do List app that can add, view, and delete tasks, with persistent storage in a `tasks.txt` file.

- **empire-state-climb** — A program that simulates a random walk to determine the probability of reaching a certain height, based on dice rolls and a small chance of falling.

## Usage
